# introduction-to-machine-learning-projects

During the course Introduction to Machine Learning (IML), we were given the opportunity to work on several mini projects 
that helped us develop our skills in Python programming and gain a better understanding of various methods such as Ridge regression and Neural Network.

Each project was thoughtfully designed to provide a practical and hands-on learning experience, 
with detailed instructions provided to guide us through the process. We were able to delve into the code and explore its workings, 
making changes and tweaks as needed to optimize the results.

Moreover, the code from these projects is available on GitHub, 
allowing us to review and reflect on our work at any time. Overall, 
the mini projects in IML were an excellent way to build our knowledge and confidence in the field of machine learning.

A huge thanks go to my group members [remdir](https://github.com/remdir) and [ProfHastings](https://github.com/ProfHastings). 
We managed to achieve an overall grade of a 6. Thanks for the good discussions and not giving up!

Note: task0 was not graded, so there is a full task description. Since the other tasks got graded and are the property of ETHZ 
I just explain the main idea of the project and the overall idea with different inputs, equations etc.
